# Personal Project Report: Web Scraping of Premier League Data using Python

## Introduction

The purpose of this personal project was to develop a web scraping application using Python to collect Premier League football data from online sources. The project aimed to extract relevant information such as match results, player statistics, team standings, and more from Premier League websites, providing an organized dataset for potential analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: To create a Python program that can scrape data from Premier League websites automatically.
2. **Data Quality**: To ensure accurate and consistent data extraction through careful handling of website structure changes.
3. **Data Privacy and Ethics**: To follow ethical scraping practices and respect the website's terms of use.

## Methodology

### Web Scraping

1. **Website Selection**: Chose premierleague.com as the primary source due to its official nature and structured data presentation.
2. **Python Libraries**: Utilized `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing and `requests` for HTTP requests.
3. **Data Points**: Scraped data points included match dates, team names, scores, player statistics, and standings.

### Scraping Process

1. **HTTP Requests**: Sent HTTP requests to target pages, imitating user behavior to access the data.
2. **Parsing**: Used `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content and extract relevant data through CSS selectors.
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data by navigating through the website's HTML structure, following links to detailed pages if necessary.

### Challenges

1. **Website Changes**: The website's structure could change over time, leading to required updates in the scraping code.

### Data Storage

1. **Data Structure**: Organized scraped data into suitable data structures such as pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Serialization**: Exported the structured data to CSV for later analysis.

## Results

The project achieved its core objectives:

- Successful scraping of Premier League data from premierleague.com.
- Creation of structured datasets containing match results.

## Limitations

1. **Data Updates**: The project did not include real-time data updates; manual scraping or scheduled automation was necessary.
2. **Website Changes**: Structural changes to the website could break the scraping code, requiring maintenance.

## Conclusion

This personal project allowed for hands-on experience with web scraping using Python. It led to the successful extraction of Premier League data, enabling the creation of organized datasets for potential future analysis. Through this project, I gained practical knowledge in web scraping techniques, HTML parsing, and data extraction, all of which enhance my programming skills and understanding of data acquisition.
